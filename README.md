# CD-OSK
Compact Disk - Operating System Kit (CD-OSK) based on the CosmosOS project.

## Building the Source Code

To build the source code, you will need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (you can install any version, community, professional, or enterprise) and grab the [Cosmos User Kit Installer](https://www.gocosmos.org/).

### Installing COSMOS in Visual Studio

See [this article](https://www.gocosmos.org/docs/install/) on the Cosmos website.

## Note about requesting features

I will only be adding features if you provide the code for it, I got too many other projects and things going on to be constantly working here. For feature requests, submit them to [DremDOS](https://github.com/sparrdrem/DremDOS/) repo instead.
